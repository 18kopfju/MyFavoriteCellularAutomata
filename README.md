# MyFavoriteCellularAutomata

## Background
To prepare for your work on this project, do the following before you begin coding:
- watch introductory CA videos [7.1](https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/5a6b36d92dba5940cf6c0f77/watch) and [7.2](https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/5a6b37282dba5940cf6c141f/watch) by Daniel Shiffman
- refresh yourself by watching [number systems intro](https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/5a20b8cb21b2c94114399c11/watch)
- refresh yourself by watching [how to convert dec -> bin](https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/5a20b8cb2a8e184120e22c22/watch)
- read [how to convert bin -> dec](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14XQQYtVhPLNQhAImkuC-J1lQsUS8d5SP8fYUjnGtvrM/edit?usp=sharing)
- practice converting bin <-> dec with [this quizlet set](https://quizlet.com/_4cue4m), until you feel comfortable with it 
- read a short background article and answer a few prep questions on the printed "CA Background" article available in the classroom (with a [digital copy here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BQXwRCNSs0nSYimqY1PKqEtDFoY3bE1a/view?usp=sharing))
- optional: browse [this page](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) for a Wolfram's overview of 1-D CA

## Coding
### Phase 1
- Have you finished all the steps listed in _Background_ above? If yes, then grab the starter code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woodstockcs/MyFavoriteCellularAutomata/master/MyFavoriteCellularAutomata.pde) and paste it into a new sketch in Processing.
- Complete the TODOs in the following methods, making sure to read any javadoc comments above the method headers:
  - constructor `CellularAutomata`

### Phase 2
Complete the TODOs in the `setRuleNumber` and the `show` methods.

Search the file for all of remaining comments starting with `//TODO` and complete each of those actions. Methods that you will work on have full javadoc comments above the method header -- *read those carefully*!
